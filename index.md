## About me

I'm currently a Ph.D candidate at the [the Veeramah Lab](https://you.stonybrook.edu/veeramahlab/) at Stony Brook University where I conduct research on the population genomics of local adaptation in Threespine Stickleback. I have background in Biomedical Science, with a master of science in Biomedical Science from Florida Atlantic University and bachelor's degree in Medical Laboratory Technology from Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST). I have previously conducted research into human diseases such as HIV/AIDS and Alzheimer's disease. During my master's degree, I explored molecular processes that engendered the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, and discovered that immediate-early genes could play major roles in the origin of this neurodegenerative disease. 
My current Ph.D. research focuses on mechanisms of local adaptation through standing genetic variation in the Threespine Stickleback model organism. In particular, I'm exploring the population dynamics that underlie adaptation of marine threespine stickleback  to freshwater habitats by Threespine Stickleback. As well, I'm interested in identifying specific selective pressures and genes that drive local adaptation.  

## Field of study 
Population genetics and molecular evolution

## Research interests
Standing genetic variation, local adaptation, precision medicine.

## Research focus 
My interest is to study adaptation through standing genetic variation in three-spined stickleback. The three-spined stickleback is an excellent model to study genetic phenonomena as adaptive evolution, genetic parallelism, contemporary evolution among others. Details of this model organism can be found in a recent [review](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-genom-111720-081402) from our lab.

I'm exploring how ancestral marine populations of the three-spined stickleback have been adapting to new freshwater habitats since at least 10 million years ago ([ref](https://meridian.allenpress.com/copeia/article-abstract/2009/2/256/115060/The-World-s-Oldest-Fossil-Threespine-Stickleback)). The speed with which marine populations adapt to freshwater habitats suggests that adaptation to freshwater habitats by marine populations is mediated by standing genetic variation (SGV) (those variations that exist in populations with no fitness benefit or could even be deleterious, but become beneficial when there is a change in environment). Our lab in collaboration with the [Kingsley Lab at Stanford](https://kingsley.stanford.edu) identified set of loci that are used repeatedly by marine three-spined stickleback to adapt to new freshwater habitats ([ref](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/25/eabg5285.abstract)). I'm 
studying how these loci change in the ancestral marine populations and what point in the life cycle of the fish do these loci experience selection. 

With a background in biomedical science, my goal is to to apply the knowledge from three-spined stickleback to develop new mathematical and/or computational models to study the evolution of human diseases at the genomic level.
