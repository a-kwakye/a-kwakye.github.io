## About me

I'm a Ph.D student at the Veeramah Lab at Stony Brook University. The primary topics we explore at [the Veeramah Lab](https://you.stonybrook.edu/veeramahlab/) include medieval paleogenomics and evolutionary genomics. We analyze multiple temporal data to study evolution of various primates such as humans, and other vertebrates like the three-spined stickleback. 

## Field of study 
Population Genetics and molecular evolution

## Research interests
Standing genetic variations, adaptive evolution, precision medicine.

## Research focus 
My interest is to study adaptation through standing genetic variation in three-spined stickleback. The three-spined stickleback is an excellent model to study genetic phenonomena as adaptive evolution, genetic parallelism, contemporary evolution among others, and details of this model organism can be found in a recent [review](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-genom-111720-081402).

I'm exploring how ancestral marine populations of the three-spined stickleback have been adapting to new freshwater habitats since at least 10 million years ago ([ref](https://meridian.allenpress.com/copeia/article-abstract/2009/2/256/115060/The-World-s-Oldest-Fossil-Threespine-Stickleback)). The speed with which marine populations adapt to freshwater habitats suggests that adaptation to freshwater habitats by marine populations is mediated by standing genetic variation (SGV) (those variations that exist in populations with no fitness benefit or could even be deleterious, but become beneficial when there is a change in environment). Our lab in collaboration with the [Kingsley Lab at Stanford](https://kingsley.stanford.edu) identified set of loci that are used repeatedly by marine three-spined stickleback to adapt to new freshwater habitats ([ref](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/25/eabg5285.abstract)). I'm 
studying how these loci change in the ancestral marine populations and what point in the life cycle of the fish do these loci experience selection. 

With a background in biomedical science, my goal is to to apply the knowledge from three-spined stickleback to develop new mathematical and/or computational models to study the evolution of human diseases at the genomic level.
